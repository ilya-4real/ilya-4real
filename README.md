### Hey👋

My name is **Ilya**. I am **back-end dev**

Currently working with:
- python 🐍
- FastAPI and other asynchronous frameworks ⚡

But deep down I am a Rust enjoyer, So don't be surprised to see memory management and borrowing in one conversation with me 😃
Also I have some experience in classic ML and a bit in neural networks 🤖
